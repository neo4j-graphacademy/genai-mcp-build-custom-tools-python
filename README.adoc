== Running the Interactive MCP Client

This repository includes a Python MCP client for testing your server.

.Start the MCP Server
[source,bash]
----
cd solutions/server
uv run main.py
----

.Run the Interactive Client (in a separate terminal)
[source,bash]
----
cd client
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
python main.py
----

The client provides an interactive menu to:

* List available tools
* Select and execute tools
* Provide parameters based on tool schemas
* View results

Select a tool by number, provide any required parameters, and press `0` or `q` to exit.
